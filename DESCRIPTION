Description: The 'ggchromatic' package provides additional colour and fill 
  scales to use with 'ggplot2'. Using the 'ggplot2' extension system, so called 
  chromatic scales are able to map a mix of continuous and discrete variables to 
  the channels of different colour spaces. The 'vctrs' package is used to wrap 
  these variables in a vector with channels, that is used by the scales to 
  encode them into colours using the 'farver' package. Additionally, there are
  guides that specialise in displaying 3D or 2D colour information.
